Invasive Species Distribution Modeling in Hawaii

A series of scripts to model global, regional, and local distributions of species using the R Statistcal Programming Software with the purpose to identify areas in Hawaii most vulnerable to invasive speces

ABOUT THE SCRIPTS:
### 0_source_script ###
source coding file that runs all other scripts with various input variables to get certain desired output results

### 1_model_fitting ###
BIOMOD2 invasive species data formatting, options, modeling, and evaluation 

### 1a_mfit_tables ###
tables to save model fitting outputs of evaluation scores and variable importance values

### 1b_mfit_graphs ###
graphs of model fitting evaluation scores and variable importance values

### 2_mod_ensembles ###
ensemble model creation from model fitting outputs

### 2a_resp_curves ###
response curve graphs from ensemble models
